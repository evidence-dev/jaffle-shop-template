## Customer cohorts
We truncate our `first_order_date` to month to create a cohort, then plot their average order value per cohort.

```customers_with_cohort
select
    *,
    date_trunc('month', first_ordered_at) as cohort_month,
    lifetime_spend_pretax / count_lifetime_orders as average_order_value_usd0

```

```cohorts_aov
select
    cohort_month,
    avg(average_order_value_usd0) as cohort_aov_usd

from ${customers_with_cohort}

group by 1
order by cohort_month
```

<BarChart
